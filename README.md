# parse-it
> Basic Parser in Emacs Lisp.

![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/parse-it/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

For most of the `major-mode` that needed a parser to act correctly. This is
a regular expression base parser. The goal of this project is to generate AST for
targeting programming language.

## üî® Supported Langauges

## üî∞ Try it yourself!

You can simply test with any script like the code under.

```el
(require 'parse-it)
(parse-it-util--print-ast-tree (parse-it 'typescript "path/to/file.ts"))
```

All tokens are listed under programming language's file itself.

## üí´ How to write one parser/AST for your favorite language?

There are 4 files you need to know before you write your own parser/AST.
And these 4 files are listed under below.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="arch" src="./docs/arch.png" width="532" height="202">
</p>

1. `parse-it.el` - Entry.
2. `parse-it-lex.el` - Lexer functionalities.
3. `parse-it-ast.el` - Build AST after lexing.
4. `parse-it-uitl` - Other helpers.

Other file than these files are the implementation for specific programming
language due to their filename. For instance, `parse-it-c.el` is for programming
language `C`. If you are trying to implement c-like programming language you should check
out `parse-it-c.el` and reuse those identifier regular expression within that
file.

### üî¨ Development

To run the test locally, you will need the following tools:

- [Eask](https://emacs-eask.github.io/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (optional)

Install all dependencies and development dependencies:

```sh
eask install-deps --dev
```

To test the package's installation:

```sh
eask package
eask install
```

To test compilation:

```sh
eask compile
```

**ü™ß The following steps are optional, but we recommend you follow these lint results!**

The built-in `checkdoc` linter:

```sh
eask lint checkdoc
```

The standard `package` linter:

```sh
eask lint package
```
